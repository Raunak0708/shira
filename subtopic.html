	<h1>Happy Birthday to the most incredible man in my life! 🥳💖  
		
		I can’t believe it’s been 1 year, 4 months, 27 days of having you by my side—every moment with you has been a dream come true. You’re not just charming, muscular, and handsome (though you *really* are 😉), but the way you handle everything with such calmness and perfection leaves me in awe every single day.  
		
		You make me feel so loved, supported, and lucky to call you mine. Here’s to celebrating *you* today and every day because you truly deserve the world. I can’t wait to make more unforgettable memories together.  
		
		<br>Love you endlessly, </br> 
		<br>Raunak Raj❤️😊</br></h1>
